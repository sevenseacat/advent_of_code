# Advent of Code

[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/sevenseacat/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sevenseacat/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)

My Elixir solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (all years).

This repository is a work in progress - I haven't yet completed all puzzles, but I'm working on them!

Each yearly event has:

* Daily solutions in `lib/y<year>/day<day>.ex`
* Tests in `tests/y<year>/day<day>_test.exs`
* Benchmarking in `lib/y<year>/README.md`
* Doctests where applicable

# Advent of Code

[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/sevenseacat/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sevenseacat/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)

My Elixir solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (all years).

This repository is a work in progress - I haven't yet completed all puzzles, but I'm working on them!

Each yearly event has:

* Daily solutions in `lib/y<year>/day<day>.ex`
* Tests in `tests/y<year>/day<day>_test.exs`
* Benchmarking in `lib/y<year>/README.md`
* Doctests where applicable

For the puzzles I completed prior to Advent of Code 2021, I've copied them from their original repositories into this repo commit by commit, modifying them to fit into my new universal structure. I've also kept the original author dates on those commits, some of them date back to 2016!
